#' Which libraries does R search for packages?

```{r}
.libPaths()
```

## let's confirm the second element is, in fact, the default library
#' Installed packages

```{r}
library(fs)
path_real(.Library)


library(tidyverse)
ipt <- installed.packages() %>%
  as_tibble()
```

```{r}
ipt
```

```{r}
tbl_vars(ipt)
```


```{r}
ipt %>%
  count(Built) %>%
  mutate(prop = n / sum(n))
```

#' Going further

## if you have time to do more ...

## is every package in .Library either base or recommended?

```{r}
all_default_pkgs <- list.files(.Library)
all_br_pkgs <- ipt %>%
  filter(Priority %in% c("base", "recommended")) %>%
  pull(Package)
setdiff(all_default_pkgs, all_br_pkgs)
```


## use `fields` argument to installed.packages() to get more info and use it!
```{r}
ipt2 <- installed.packages(fields = "URL") %>%
  as_tibble()
ipt2 %>%
  mutate(github = grepl("github", URL)) %>%
  count(github) %>%
  mutate(prop = n / sum(n))

```
